# Coursera Data Science Specialization
# Capstone Project: Bated Breath Word Generator

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to make an interactive Shiny web app that takes a sequence of words (a sentence fragment) as input and then predicts the most probable possibilities for the next word as output. This should be achieved by using an n-gram model.

**Data**

The data used for this project are a random subset of blogs, news, and tweet items (350,000 items) used to build a catalog of n-grams (sentence fragment of n words; n = 1:5) and their occurrence counts. The source blogs, news, and tweet data can be obtained [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip). The source data files and intermediate data files are too large to be stored on GitHub, so to make use of this, please repeat all steps in R.

**Presentation**

The capstone presentation is [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JosephMartin610/coursera_data_science_capstone_bated_breath_word_generator/blob/main/word_generator_presentation-rpubs.html). It has information about model basis and performance.

**App**

During the capstone project, the app was deployed on shinyapps.io, but having a word prediction app that performs decently requires significant memory, and that requires a paid plan on shinyapps.io.
